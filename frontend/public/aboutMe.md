# About me

_Hi\!_ My name is **Ilya Quateau**. I’m a programmer, gamer and computer enthusiast. I love designing websites, finding solutions to complex problems and managing servers. I run my own servers at home and I write simple (and more complex) programs to make every day life a bit easier.

## My story

It all began when I got my very first game on the Nintendo DS Lite in 2007\. I quickly learned that computers were capable of doing some amazing things. That small box with a screen and a few buttons executed difficult tasks in the blink of an eye. For me, this opened a new door to endless possibilities. I now realize that this was the moment that my life long journey began.

As I grew older, I moved from playing on the Nintendo to explore games on our family’s first generation iPad. Around this time I also got my first smartphone: a Samsung Galaxy Mini 2\. This gave me the freedom to wander around the internet and that’s when I inevitably discovered YouTube. One day I came across a cool looking video of someone playing a game that I hadn’t seen before. It looked awesome and I watched more and more videos before I found out that the game they were playing was Minecraft. I watched a lot of Minecraft videos but couldn’t play by myself as I didn’t really have a pc on which I could just download games, let alone buy any.

That’s when I discovered Minecraft: Pocket Edition, a version of the game specifically made for mobile devices. After a lot of begging, I finally convinced my parents to buy my first and only paid game ever on that old iPad. I played it like crazy. My free time basically evolved into hours upon hours of just Minecraft gameplay and video’s. I was obsessed with the game and wanted to build more bases and make more stuff.

That’s when I learned that the PC version of the game had way more features than on the iPad. Somehow my parents allowed me to buy it and install the game on our family laptop. Because of this, I had to learn how to actually work with a computer. I learned how to type previously but never really had to work much on a pc for school or any other activities. I started fiddling around with different programs, websites and basically everything else on the laptop. Fast forward a few months and I have a good understanding of the basic tasks a computer can do.

At that point \- I must have been around 13, maybe 14 years old \- I wanted to make my own programs. After a lot of research and many YouTube videos, I wrote my first program in Batch, a basic scripting language built into Windows. It was a very basic text adventure game with many bugs and very complicated code for something so simple. Nonetheless I was very proud of what I had achieved and immediately showed it to my friends. Although I thought I achieved something big, my friends did not share my enthusiasm and thought that it “wasn’t such a big deal.” I wasn’t very happy with the way they reacted and because of that I stopped programming for a while.

The year after, my interest in programming suddenly grew again. I didn’t want to code in Batch anymore so I looked around for other programming or scripting languages that were well documented and easy to learn. That’s when I discovered Python. Python is a relatively simple, yet extremely powerful scripting language. Its popularity was growing exponentially and up-to-date tutorials and well written documentation were popping up everywhere. At the time, it was considered to be the perfect first real language to learn and that’s exactly what I did.

That summer, I started programming in Python on my personal laptop. I took it with me on vacation and on the way there I programmed for hours in the car. I didn’t make very difficult or mind-blowing scripts, but I learned a lot and got some results that I was proud of. For some reason after the summer, my interest faded away for a bit and I didn’t code a lot until August 2018\. That’s when I started programming a bot for a discord server. It was a lot of fun to make something that was actually useful and my friends thought so too. Although practically none of them learned to code themselves, they had a newfound respect for what I could do with my Python bot. Suddenly I found it very cool to be able to bring my ideas to life and it made me decide that I wanted to learn even more about the ins and outs of software.

This dream became a reality when in September 2019 I decided to enrol in Electronics-ICT at Odisee Ghent. I learned a lot of interesting and cool things about computers, including Java and making basic websites using HTML/CSS and PHP. After about 6 months I had to choose a specification that I wanted to continue in and at the time, networking and computer infrastructure sounded like the perfect match for me. A bit later I learned to configure Windows and Linux servers and learned a lot about Cisco networking, however times were about to change…

March 2020: the COVID-19 pandemic hits Belgium and everything goes into lockdown. Schools close, everyone has to stay indoors unless absolutely necessary and all social contact suddenly disappears. As an 18 year old student, I was isolated in my student room in Ghent, only to come back home on the weekends. All my courses were completely online and I had a very hard time keeping my focus on my school work. The lack of social control while attending an online class proved to be very bad for my workflow and I started doing less and less.

The next 2 years must have been some of the lowest points of my life. I lost interest in networking and infrastructure, barely had social contact and met basically 0 new people. All this affected my studies a lot and I failed over and over on multiple courses. When Covid finally settled down a bit, it was already too late. I failed a course too many times and had to quit the curriculum.

I was met with 2 options: either get a job and go work without any certificates or degrees, or study something else. I knew that I didn’t want to waste those 3 years that I studied to end up with absolutely nothing so in my mind, I didn’t really have a choice. I started to look for a different study I could do. I looked at many different things before I finally found the curriculum of Programming at HoGent. Despite the name, it was no longer in Ghent but rather in Aalst which is the city right next to where I live. I moved back home with my parents and started a new year…

The new curriculum proved to be exactly what I needed. I realized that the infrastructure courses I had before were not my true passion, but rather the programming itself. By coming to that conclusion, and making some new friends post-covid who have the same interests, I performed way better than ever before. After 2 years of learning and hands-on experience, I graduated with great distinction as a Full Stack Developer. I was lucky enough to be hired right away by Kapernikov, the company where I did my internship during my studies. Sadly after 8 months of working there, I found myself back home in search of a new opportunity. At the time of writing, I’m still looking for a company who wants to work together and offer me a new challenge. The search is not just difficult, but very hard on my self esteem and confidence. I’m hoping that by sharing my story and documenting my journey I can find myself in a better position to talk to interesting companies who could use my help.

Sometimes I think about that little boy who just got his very first laptop. Sometimes I remember what it felt like to run my very first Batch script. I once again see programming as I saw it all those years ago: magic\! A kind of magic that inspires. A kind of magic that lets you create your wildest dreams. A kind of magic that almost literally makes the world go around. And for me it all started as a 6 year old boy.

And that old Nintendo? It still runs perfectly fine to this day.
